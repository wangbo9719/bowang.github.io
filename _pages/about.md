I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student from the Department of Artificial Intelligence at Jilin University, supervised by Prof. Yi Chang. Now I am a visiting scholar at Michigan State University (MSU), under the supervision of Prof. Jiliang Tang.

My research interests are natural language processing and trustworthy AI.
